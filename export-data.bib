	abstract = {How the internet's memory infrastructure developed—averting a "digital dark age"—and introduced a golden age of historical memory.In early 1996, the web was ephemeral. But by 2001, the internet was forever. How did websites transform from having a brief life to becoming long-lasting? Drawing on archival material from the Internet Archive and exclusive interviews, Ian Milligan's Averting the Digital Dark Age explores how Western society evolved from fearing a digital dark age to building the robust digital memory we rely on today. By the mid-1990s, the specter of a "digital dark age" haunted libraries, portending a bleak future with no historical record that threatened cyber obsolescence, deletion, and apathy. People around the world worked to solve this impending problem. In San Francisco, technology entrepreneur Brewster Kahle launched his scrappy nonprofit, Internet Archive, filling tape drives with internet content. Elsewhere, in Washington, Canberra, Ottawa, and Stockholm, librarians developed innovative new programs to safeguard digital heritage. Cataloging worries among librarians, technologists, futurists, and writers from WWII onward, through early practitioners, to an extended case study of how September 11 prompted institutions to preserve thousands of digital artifacts related to the attacks, Averting the Digital Dark Age explores how the web gained a long-lasting memory. By understanding this history, we can equip our society to better grapple with future internet shifts.},

Since the 1990s the world wide web (or simply, the web) has been an integral and important part of the communicative infrastructure of modern societies. On the one hand the web has developed as a new medium in its own right, in continuation of other media types such as newspapers, film, radio and television. On the other hand, the web has been intimately entangled in the social, cultural and political life taking place outside of the web. For example, within the realm of politics the web has been essential for the extreme left and right since the mid 1990s (as a platform for discussion and mobilisation as well as for the diffusion of political ideas). And in everyday life an important part of modern youth culture has for a number of years been closely connected to such web phenomena as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.},

	abstract = {Contemporary approaches to the investigation of digital resources are dominated by the paradigm of free-form natural language search, popularised by Google. The Google form of searching has shaped our view of digital possibilities and profoundly affects our search and research habits. Yet in early pioneering work which led to the digital revolution of the 1990s, search was not a major consideration and there was a stronger emphasis on linking files. With the rise of very large born-digital resources such as e-mail archives, Wikileak dumps and web archives, the limitations of Google-type searching are becoming more evident. This paper reviews the limitations of search in exploring born-digital archives and starts to sketch out possible approaches to an alternative. It is suggested that a return to digital roots, by renewing the interest of pioneers such as Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson in the linking of files, may provide one approach to born-digital archives.},

	abstract = {Web archives are essential to support historical scholarship in the online age. Research on web archives spans many disciplines, often requiring domain-specific expertise. The wide-ranging nature of the literature makes it difficult to obtain a current overview of the field, but this view is needed to identify which core challenges define the field, and assess the different approaches taken to address them. This paper provides such a review of the current landscape of web archives research, focusing on addressing the common challenges faced to support scholarly use of archived web materials. The analysis describes three challenges and identifies key concepts and current approaches for each: (1) how to organize and select from web archives collections; (2) how to critically examine these sources; and (3) how to approach ethics and consent for using archived web materials. The discussion addresses open questions and tensions, highlighting the sociotechnical nature of these challenges and revealing opportunities to apply existing work from the body of knowledge of information studies. It concludes with several recommendations for future research directions to support scholarly use of web archives.},

	abstract = {The field of web archiving is at a turning point. In the early years of web archiving, the single URL has been the dominant unit for preservation and access. Access tools such as the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine reflect this notion as they allowed consultation, or browsing, of one URL at a time. In recent years, however, the single URL approach to accessing web archives is being gradually replaced by search interfaces. This paper addresses the theoretical and methodological implications of the transition to search on web archive research. It introduces ‘search as research’ methods, practices already applied in studies of the live web, which can be repurposed and implemented for critically studying archived web data. Such methods open up a variety of analytical practices that were so far precluded by the single URL entry point to the web archive, such as the re-assemblage of existing collections around a theme or an event, the study of archival artefacts and scaling the unit of analysis from the single URL to the full archive, by generating aggregate views and summaries. The paper introduces examples to ‘search as research’ scenarios, which have been developed by the WebART project at the University of Amsterdam and the Centrum Wiskunde \& Informatica, in collaboration with the National Library of the Netherlands. The paper concludes with a discussion of current and potential limitations of ‘search as research’ methods for studying web archives, and the ways with which they can be overcome in the near future.},

In terms of their use of information technologies (IT), museums have evolved from initial experiments in the 1950s to a significant online presence today. In the process of digital transformation, museums have shaped their digital identity, aiming to expand their activities beyond museum walls with emerging new roles in the digital era. The concept of museums’ digital identity is the focus of this paper. To articulate the concept, the theory of digital identity, the methodology of web history, the concept of virtual museums, and museum branding, are brought into consideration. The author articulates the concept of museums’ digital identity and outlines a number of components at the collective and individual levels embodied in national strategies and policy documents relating to digital transformation, articulated in statements by museum associations, revealed in features of their online presence, and embedded in brand design. In the conclusion, the author raises questions about the driving force of museums in developing digital identity and the need to comprehensively analyse the multiplatform museum presence.},

	abstract = {XS4ALL is een van de belangrijkste bronnen voor de geschiedenis van innovatie op het Nederlandse Internet. Het was een van de eerste Internetproviders van Nederland waar particulieren klant konden worden en heeft een rijke geschiedenis die nog niet uitputtend is beschreven. Vanaf 1 mei 1993 konden mensen zich opgeven voor een Internetaansluiting en vanaf 1994 bestond de mogelijkheid om een homepage te publiceren op het web. Veel Nederlandse Internetpioniers hebben hier hun eerste digitale sporen achtergelaten. Omdat deze provider nooit van naam is veranderd en veel klanten van het eerste uur dit bedrijf trouw zijn gebleven, is een uniek aantal XS4ALL-homepages uit het verre verleden nog steeds online op het web. Ondanks dit historische belang heeft tot nu toe nog nooit een grondige inventarisatie plaatsgevonden van de homepages of zijn deze systematisch gearchiveerd. Toen op 10 januari 2019 KPN aankondigde de zelfstandigheid van XS4ALL binnen het concern te beëindigen, heeft de KB een reddingsactie op touw gezet om de homepages met de meeste erfgoedwaarde te bewaren in een speciale webcollectie met XS4ALL-websites. Het ontstaan, de inhoud en het nut van deze collectie is beschreven in deze collectiebeschrijving. De KB-webcollectie (het webarchief van KB-Nationale Bibliotheek van Nederland) is een van de digitale collecties van de Koninklijke Bibliotheek. Het is het digitaal geboren deel van de Collectie Nederland. Het bevat een selectie van 20.391 websites (per 31 december 2020) van het Nederlandse nationale webdomein die periodiek gearchiveerd worden. Ooit werd de webcollectie gezien als een bijzondere bibliotheekcollectie, maar vanwege de verandering in de definitie van een publicatie en met het oog op de wens voor een toekomstige harvest van het Nederlandse nationale domein worden websites vanaf 2019 beschouwd als een onderdeel van de Nederlandcollectie. Deze nationale collectie bevat analoge en digitale publicaties van en over Nederland. De KB-webcollectie bevat een unieke selectie van digitaal geboren bronmateriaal en data over de Nederlandse digitale cultuur die nergens anders ter wereld in deze vorm wordt verzameld, beschreven, bewaard en kan worden geraadpleegd. Bovendien is dit materiaal binnen afzienbare tijd niet meer op het live web te vinden, maar alleen nog maar in de digitale collectie van de KB aanwezig en alleen in het gebouw van de KB te bestuderen. Het streven is om representatieve websites uit Nederland of over Nederland te selecteren, waarbij de primaire focus gericht is op websites die betrekking hebben op Nederlandse taal, cultuur, politiek, geschiedenis en samenleving en – in mindere mate - de informatiestroom van de Nederlandse overheid. De KB streeft ernaar om de webcollecties met gearchiveerde sites aan te bieden met zoveel mogelijk technische, historische en inhoudelijke achtergrondinformatie voor de gebruiker. De webcollectie krijgt zo een context met redactionele informatie. Hiermee wordt helderheid geboden over de historische context van de collectie, hoe de webcollectie is opgebouwd en wat de mogelijkheden en wensen zijn voor de toekomst. Daarnaast wordt uiteengezet hoe de primaire gebruikers (wetenschappers of andere geïnteresseerden) optimaal gebruik kunnen maken van de webcollectie.},

	abstract = {– The purpose of this paper is to situate the activity of digitisation to increase access to cultural and heritage content alongside the objectives of the Open Access Movement (OAM). It demonstrates that increasingly open licensing of digital cultural heritage content is creating opportunities for researchers in the arts and humanities for both access to and analysis of cultural heritage materials. , – The paper is primarily a literature and scoping review of the current digitisation licensing climate, using and embedding examples from ongoing research projects and recent writings on Open Access (OA) and digitisation to highlight both opportunities and barriers to the creation and use of digital heritage content from galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM). , – The digital information environment in which digitised content is created and delivered has changed phenomenally, allowing the sharing and reuse of digital data and encouraging new advances in research across the sector, although issues of licensing persist. There remain further opportunities for understanding how to: study use and users of openly available cultural and heritage content; disseminate and encourage the uptake of open cultural data; persuade other institutions to contribute their data into the commons in an open and accessible manner; build aggregation and search facilities to link across information sources to allow resource discovery; and how best to use high-performance computing facilities to analyse and process the large amounts of data the author is now seeing being made available throughout the sector. , – It is hoped that by pulling together this discussion, the benefits to making material openly available have been made clear, encouraging others in the GLAM sector to consider making their collections openly available for reuse and repurposing. , – This paper will encourage others in the GLAM sector to consider licensing their collections in an open and reusable fashion. By spelling out the range of opportunities for researchers in using open cultural and heritage materials it makes a contribution to the discussion in this area. , – Increasing the quantity of high-quality OA resources in the cultural heritage sector will lead to a richer research environment which will increase the understanding of history, culture and society. , – This paper has pulled together, for the first time, an overview of the current state of affairs of digitisation in the cultural and heritage sector seen through the context of the OAM. It has highlighted opportunities for researchers in the arts, humanities and social and historical sciences in the embedding of open cultural data into both their research and teaching, whilst scoping the wave of cultural heritage content which is being created from institutional repositories which are now available for research and use. As such, it is a position paper that encourages the open data agenda within the cultural and heritage sector, showing the potentials that exists for the study of culture and society when data are made open.},
